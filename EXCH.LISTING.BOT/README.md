**What is the purpose?**

A listing of a token on an exchange usually positively correlates with the token price. This channel helps to accurately predict the listing of a new token on an exchange before the official announcement in order to purchase the token on a less popular exchange and profit from the price surge after the listing.

In essence, the channel aims to predict the token listing for speculative purposes.

**How does it work?**

Before listing and ERC-20 token an exchange first runs a test on its wallets. The "Crypto Exchange Listings" software monitors the exchange wallets and posts a notification on the channel t.me/CryptoExchangeListing whenever a previously unlisted token appears in the wallets.

It should however be noted that the appearance of a new token on an exchange wallet doesn't necessarily mean it is getting listed: it could be an airdrop, could be somebody sending their tokens on an exchange etc. We use emojis to separate shitcoins from normal coins, that are listed on coinmarketcap.com :)

The software currently monitors the following exchanges:
- Binance
- Bittrex
- BitFinex
- Qryptos
- Poloniex
- liqui
- Kucoin
- HitBTC
- YoBit
- Gate.io
- OKEx
- IDEX
- Huobi
- Kraken
- Bitstamp
- Cryptopia
- Bibox
- Upbit
- and counting...

**Development plans?**

We are constantly expanding the list of exchanges and addresses, as well as developing a listing notification service through the open API of the exchanges. This means that there will be 2 types of notifications: token x has been spotted on a wallet, token x has officially been listed on the exchange.

Monitoring of non-ERC-20 tokens is in development.

**Additional info**

Note:

 - the channel is fully automated and is currently in testing phase
